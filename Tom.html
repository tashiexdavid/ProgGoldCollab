    <h1>How Education has Changed</h1>
    <p>
      Education has changed dramatically with the rise of technology. Learning
      is no longer confined to classrooms — students can now access online
      courses, digital textbooks, and interactive tools from anywhere. Teachers
      use multimedia and data-driven methods to personalize lessons, while
      collaboration through video calls and shared documents connects learners
      globally. Overall, computing has made education more accessible, flexible,
      and engaging than ever before. We can breakdown the impact of computing on
      education into three main pillars:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access</li>
      <li>Teaching Methods</li>
      <li>Collaboration</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Access</h2>
    <p>
      Technology has made education far more accessible. Online platforms,
      digital libraries, and open courses allow people to learn anytime and
      anywhere, breaking barriers of location and cost.
    </p>

    <h3>Teaching Methods</h3>
    <p>
      Computing has transformed how lessons are taught. Interactive tools,
      videos, and data-driven feedback make learning more engaging and tailored
      to each student’s pace and needs.
    </p>

    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
    <p>
      Digital platforms enable students and teachers to connect instantly, share
      ideas, and work together on projects, no matter where they are in the
      world. This global interaction builds teamwork and broadens perspectives.
