<h1>How Education has Changed</h1>
<p>Education has changed dramatically with the rise of technology. Learning is no longer confined to classrooms — students can now access online courses, digital textbooks, and interactive tools from anywhere.
     Teachers use multimedia and data-driven methods to personalize lessons, while collaboration through video calls and shared documents connects learners globally. Overall, computing has made education more accessible, flexible, and engaging than ever before.

<ul>
    <li>Access</li>
    <li>Teaching methods</li>
</ul>
